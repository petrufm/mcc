Model Capture for C++

This reverse engineering tool extracts design information from C++ source code producing a set of text tables containing design facts. Next, the information from these tables can be used by other tools to perform higher-level analysis for the investigated C++ code such as design metrics, design flaw detection, etc. More details abut this program can be found at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4438085.
